          Our group name is BieTechVN. Which can be understood as newbies with
          beginner minds in Vietnam technology industry. However, the name can
          be understood in a different way. “Bie” can be quite like “Bee”, which
          indicates that we are hard-working bees trying to use technology as a
          tool to add value to our community. As bees, we must have the unity to
          bring any dreams come true, any great project to benefit the society
          needs a team of bees. For the word “VN”, we thought of it as a
          statement. We believe us, as Vietnamese, we have the potential to
          write our names on the world record, on par with the powers of the
          five continents, from that believe, we must unite and be hard work as
          bees to make Vietnam become a developed country.

              Technology is gaining more impacts on our life, I could see in any
              industry, technology is necessary to grow. As a Communication
              student, I can tell that information is now being transfer in
              seconds and travel around the world thanks to technology
              development. For instance, studying at RMIT have a huge benefit
              regarding its technological system and support, student have
              advantages in terms of fast and convenience class enrolling, send
              and receive information, communication with others...Imagine
              applying that technological efficiency to other model of business,
              employees and customers will have great experience with our
              company. However, technology is replacing human occupations, so by
              understanding how technology replace people jobs, we can see the
              gap where technology cannot replace, so that people with not be
              unemployed. My interest in IT is learning it theoretically. My
              dream job is to be a monk.

              First semester at RMIT, I have the chance to know qualified
              learning tools, valuable resources, flexible schedule. Entering
              the IT world, I want to challenge myself in the fast growth of
              networking. Technology is vital to satisfy and cater human needs.
              Noticeably, technology has been having a significant role in
              healthcare, food and beverage, factory, etc. During Covid
              pandemic, I expressed my interest particularly in a database of
              variants, utilized to monitor and tackle the spread of the Corona
              virus. The aforementioned factors are the reasons why technology
              has captured my interest. My ideal career path is to become a
              Software Tester. In this tech age, people can easily bank, shop,
              and book transportation online. If these data are not secured,
              they can be threats for the government, businesses, and users. By
              studying cybersecurity, I will protect networks against potential
              harm and guarantee an error-free system. In my first course at
              RMIT, I am interacting with SQL and Oracle, which help me to
              enhance my understanding of system databases. I could also deal
              with networking sites due to my knowledge of Linux commands.

              My name is Nghia, but you can call me Lazi. I am 19 and currently
              an IT student at RMIT, and this is my first semester. In my free
              time, I spend most of it on playing games, hanging out with
              friends, and playing guitar. Not a usual game addict, I play games
              for other meanings, such as the fascinating use of hacking skill
              to get the highest objectives in the game instead of spending time
              working hard. In addition, I found that hacking is not accessible
              without essential knowledge. I have gained experience about IT
              features, such as hacking skills required me to mastered in many
              machine languages, such as Python, C, C++, and so on. I have one
              dream career: to be a network defender to fight against attackers.
              Hence, I choose RMIT as a space to develop my knowledge and skill.
              I am currently in the halo step of being part of the BIETECHVN
              team, which has two of my friends in my IT path and we are making
              our projects idea come to life.

              I am Tran Gia Vong, and I am from BieTechVN. I am a first-year
              student at RMIT. After spending two years serving in the military,
              during which I had a chance to participate in helping the
              government control and fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, I went
              to study my IT major. My strengths are English and communication
              with other people. As I am an energetic and extrovert person, I
              tend to talk to strangers and make new friend. I like to talk
              about random topics and exchange knowledge about them. In
              addition, I am also an enthusiastic basketball player. In IT
              world, my favourite section is programming. I find interested in
              the way programming can be utilized to solve problems with
              efficiency and accuracy, within a short period of time. As an IT
              student, I hope to become a programmer that creates useful
              applications to assist people and benefit them in any way
              possible. However, my experience in IT is limited and I am trying
              my best to gain more. As an IT student, I really hope that one day
              I can help build and create useful applications to help making
              people’s lives more convenient and provide good quality services.
