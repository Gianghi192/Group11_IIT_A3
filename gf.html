          At the end of this project, as we are reflecting on our journey, there
          are many things that can be improved, but all in all, this project
          brought us precious experiences and great time working as a team.
          Firstly, we have not finished the whole project, which we all feel a
          little down in the dumps. Although we planned it well, brainstormed on
          the idea well, as we went to execute, we realized there were a lot we
          had yet to know about IT world. Not so surprising it is coined as a
          ‘world’. But from that surprise, we had the chance to proactively look
          for solutions, looking for short-term online courses about web
          development, spending extra time to dive deeper into what we had
          learned in class. And if we can turn back time, we would spend more
          time together to work on this project face to face, since we felt that
          working this way would bring us more energy and motivation. That was
          also one mistake we made when we mostly met online and only faced each
          other once a week. We were surprised at how hard developing a game
          website could be, and the depth of making an engaging website was even
          harder. It took a lot of small details to create a big and beautiful
          picture as the picture created in our idea. We have learned that
          working in a group, specifically in an IT project, we need patience
          and lots of hard work. That was more valuable than finishing this
          project since we are freshman, we see the value of learning and
          practicing can make perfect, we see things that we can bring with us
          to the workplace, to our daily lives, values that we could keep and
          improve from for a lifetime. Another mistake we made was not strictly
          set small deadlines for the details, that brought us to a small level
          of frustration at the near end of the project when we had to chase the
          clock to wrap things up. But that was also when we learned how to keep
          our head cool, focused and tried our best to finish the web. We would
          say this project was a meaningful experience for us to get to know
          each other, getting to know the tendency of how the workplace will be
          and knowing how to work under pressure, knowing how to self-learn to
          overcome our own limitation. We had learned invaluable practical
          skills on web development, using technology software, communicating
          with our colleagues, and the most valuable thing we learn was that
          under a fresh, creative, comfortable environment of working, we can
          thrive and perform at our best.

          At the end of this project, I have been feeling blessed having the
          best teammates in IT world, which you can ever imagine during your
          college career. I can be seen as the dumbbell of my team since I did
          not know how to write code and use technology to create web games.
          Luckily, I could write this report and contribute on the brainstorming
          process. Everything from planning to executing this project went well,
          and it would be much better if my team had someone who can help them
          in coding and generating the web game. What was surprising and what I
          had learned was that my teammates were so patient, and we stayed
          united and had each other back throughout the project. However, I had
          learned that stepping out of your comfort zone and try new things can
          bring valuable experience and memories, such as mine with IT and my
          team

        <p>
          I just recently entered this area, so at the beginning, I was far from
          knowing what I was doing to design an interface for a web application
          and faced a lot of challenges. As a project manager, but I couldn't
          figure out our entire procedure. Then I split the whole project,
          defined its scope and goals, and finally grasped it. I have gained
          enough knowledge from this course and learning from YouTube to figure
          out what features are included on the website. One of the valuable
          things I have learned is about the GitHub repository, where we store
          the project and keep track of the progress of our process. Another
          technical skill that I have gained in this assignment is my
          proficiency in using HTML and CSS, as well as a basic understanding of
          JavaScript. Besides that, I appreciate that I have the precious time
          to collaborate with my teams, discuss our projects, and share our
          knowledge in this technological field.

          Besides many difficulties during the processing of the project,
          however, I have cultivated through much knowledge for future studying.
          At first, I had to deal with many problems such as running out of
          ideas or not having enough knowledge to do the project and also the
          mission that we had separated. Secondly, I have to spend a lot of time
          focusing on fixing bugs that I had coding. After all, these
          difficulties, it has inspired me to do hard work on things and enhance
          teamwork skills. I have to spend a lot of time focusing on fixing bugs

        <h2>Tran Gia Vong – s4012094</h2>

        <p>
          One thing I learned during our project was that I need to test my html
          files with every change I make to the file. This helped me keep track
          of what my html files looked like. Therefore, this is a valuable
          experience for my future projects on html. Also, this group is the
          best group I have ever worked with. We support each other on our work,
          we divide tasks and complete them within due time, and we also were
          very active in our project. All I can say is that this is the dream
          team I have been desiring. Those are not all, I learned a lot through
          this project while progressing. I had to learn from different sources
          including YouTube, websites, and from inspecting websites. Especially
          for inspecting websites, I had a chance to learn from the IT
          professionals on how they build their websites. Overall, this is
          considered my most valuable and best-experienced project so far.
